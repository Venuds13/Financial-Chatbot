Overview:
-----------
This is a simple AI-powered chatbot built using Python and Streamlit. It provides predefined financial insights for selected companies and fiscal years.

How It Works:
--------------
- The chatbot loads financial data from `combined_financial_data.csv`.
- Users select a company and a fiscal year from dropdown menus.
- A predefined set of questions is available for selection.
- Based on the user query and selected filters, the chatbot returns canned responses using conditional logic.

Predefined Questions:
----------------------
1. What is the total revenue?
2. How has net income changed over the last year?
3. What are the total assets?
4. What are the total liabilities?
5. What is the operating cash flow?

Optional Feature:
------------------
âœ… A financial trends section (line chart + bar chart) allows users to visualize revenue, net income, assets, liabilities, and cash flow over multiple years for the selected company.

How to Run:
------------
1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install streamlit pandas matplotlib

3. Run the app:
   streamlit run app.py
